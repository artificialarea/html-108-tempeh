# HTML-108-tempeh

**Experiment** At some point the Postgres DB on Heroku for **HTML-108-server** broke, likely due to some sort of upgrade done by Heroku who doesn't care about hobby dynos. (Seperatately?) I'm having issues migrating and redeploying to production, too.

Due to much of this being a hazy memory, I'm opting to go through the entire process again with a seperate temporary repo and new heroku app to refresh my recollection of all the aspects of deploying to production. Hopefully when I come out the other side I'll realise where the problem lies.

The HTML-108 is a minimal browser-based step synthesizer.

A nostalgic nod to the synthesizer hardware of the 1980s, like the seminal [Roland TR-808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808), that ushered in several genres of electronic music.

Personally, it also enabled me to explore the wonderful world of the Web Audio API and the Tone.js javascript framework.
